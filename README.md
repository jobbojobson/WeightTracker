# WeightTracker
A simple daily weight tracker based on PHP and AJAX

The intention of this application is to provide a weight tracking solution that is slightly less unwieldy than a forever-growing spreadsheet.

At the time of initial commit this is a simple weight tracking app that allows you to record a daily weight value in kilograms and offers a 7 day rolling average of historical data. It also holds some basic information about you so that it can show you BMI/BMR.

It makes use of Google Charts to present a line chart of data.
